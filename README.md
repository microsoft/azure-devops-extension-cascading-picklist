# Cascading Picklists Extension

This extension can be found in the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.cascading-picklists-extension 'Download Cascading Lists extension').

## Cascading Picklists

This extension uses the `ms.vss-work-web.work-item-form` contribution point that enables you to build a cascading picklist on the work item form. Cascading picklists are made up of two seperate fields. The parent field and a child field. The parent picklist will contain a list of values, that when a value is selected, will display the values in the child list.

### Create a picklist

First, create a picklist of parent values. Second, create a picklist of child values. This child picklist will contain **all** possible values. We will configure how those values get displayed in the extension configuration.

### Configure

Once both picklists have been created and configured, you can configure what child picklist values will be displayed. You do this by going to the "Cascading Lists" Hub in project settings. From here, configure the value for the parent picklist, so that when selected, the child values will be displayed.

Config example:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "cascades": {
      "Custom.MajorRelease": {
          "Release Blue": {
              "Custom.MinorRelease": [
                  "Blue.1",
                  "Blue.2",
                  "Blue.3"
              ]
          },
          "Release Red": {
              "Custom.MinorRelease": [
                  "Red.A",
                  "Red.B",
                  "Red.C"
              ]
          }
      }
  }
}
```

#### Tips

1. You must know the refname of the custom picklist fields. You can use [List Fields REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/list?view=azure-devops-rest-5.0) if you need help finding the value.

2. The values setup in the picklist and the values in the configuration must be an exact match. There is no validation to check or correct spelling mistakes in the values.

## Get started with Extensions

Building and testing the extension requires following.

1.  [Download and install NodeJS](http://nodejs.org 'NodeJS Website')
